       <p>Vootrekker High School was founded in 1934. It was the first Afrikaans high school in the southern suburbs. In 1992 it opened its doors to all learners, irrespective of creed, color or culture.</p>

    <div class="Sentence4">
        <p>Due to the dwindling numbers of Afrikaans speaking learners in the southern suburbs, the first English speaking grade 8 class started their high school career in 2003. For the next 9 years until 2011, Voortrekker operated as a dual medium school and in 2012, only English speaking grade 8 learners were admitted.</p>
    
        <br>

        <p>During its 80 years of existence, Voortrekker kept up with the many changes which were implemented nationally and today we provide education to a wide spectrum of learners. Our learners composition is a true reflection of our "rainbow nation" where learners enjoy education in a multi-cultural school environment.</p>

        <p> Over the years, not just academics but sport has also played a major role in our school. Our top sport has and still is rugby. Not only do we have rugby, we have a range of options when it comes to sport like, soccer, netball, softball. But we are more well known for rugby and we can say that soccer is also becoming a more well-known sport at our school.</p>
